As part of the job interview process, you received the following take-home assignment:\n\nYou are asked to use the provided dataset to understand the popularity of different Lego sets and themes. The idea is to become familiarized with the data to be ready for an interview with a business stakeholder.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f8b70d12"},{"source":"<img src=\"http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2014/02/LEGOHeader2.jpg\">","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"69e888ac-1b85-43c3-a325-d1617a8d2e1a"},{"source":"## 💾 The data\n\n#### You received access to a database with the following tables.

(as in the parts table)\n- \"color_id\" - id of the color\n- \"quantity\" - the number of copies of the part included in the set\n- \"is_spare\" - whether or not it is a spare part\n\n#### parts\n- \"part_num\" - unique id for the part (as in the inventory_parts table)\n- \"name\" - name of the part\n- \"part_cat_id\" - part category id (as in part_catagories table)\n\n#### part_categories\n- \"id\" - part category id (as in parts table)\n- \"name\" - name of the category the part belongs to\n\n#### colors\n- \"id\" - id of the color (as in inventory_parts table)\n- \"name\" - color
